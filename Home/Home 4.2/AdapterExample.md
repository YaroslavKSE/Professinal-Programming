On of the examples when adapter pattern can be used is the situation when in client-server application all the api is designed to use Json, however, you need to implement the new feature where the server expects XML format. Implementing the Adapter class for converting Json body to XML and vise verse can solve the issue. It will remove the need to rewrite the logic and the existing code. You as a developer is responsible for only creating the adapter class where you will implement the needed methods for the client to work with.
